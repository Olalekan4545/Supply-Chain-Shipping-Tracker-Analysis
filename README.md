# Supply-Chain-Shipping-Tracker-Analysis
The supply Chain is the network of production and logistics involved in producing and delivering goods to customers. This dasboard is created using Powerbi


## Project Overview
This project analyzes supply chain data to monitor revenue, shipping costs, stock levels, defect rates, and transportation performance. The dashboard provides insights to support operational and logistics decision-making.

## Objectives
- Track total revenue and pricing metrics :to identify high-performing products and growth opportunities.
- Monitor shipping costs and delivery performance :to Reduces cost and improves delivery efficiency.
- Analyze defect rates by transportation mode and product type: to reduces returns and improves product quality.
- Evaluate stock levels across SKUs:to Prevents stockouts and overstocking.
- Compare performance across carriers and transportation modes:to choose the best shipping option for cost and reliability.

## Dataset
The dataset includes supply chain information such as:
- SKU
- Product type (cosmetics, haircare, skincare)
- Transportation mode (Air, Rail, Road, Sea)
- Shipping carrier
- Revenue, price, and shipping cost
- Stock levels and defect rates

## Key Metrics (KPIs)
- Total Revenue Generated **578k**
- Total Price **4,946**
- Total Shipping Cost **554.81**
- Total Stock Levels **4777**
- Total Shipping Time **575**

## Dashboard Features
- Interactive slicers for SKU, product type, transportation mode, and carrier
- Revenue and cost breakdown by product type
- Shipping cost comparison by carriers and transportation modes
- Defect rate analysis across transportation modes
- Stock level tracking by SKU

## Insights
- Skincare products generate the highest revenue compared to other product types
- Road and Air transportation incur higher shipping costs than Sea transport
- Certain transportation modes show higher defect rates depending on product type
- Carrier performance varies in terms of cost efficiency

## Recommendations

- Investigate and reduce defect rates for high-risk transportation modes.
- Negotiate better shipping rates and choose cost-effective carriers.
- Restock low inventory SKUs and set minimum reorder levels.
- Focus on high revenue products for marketing and stock planning.
- Replace or improve low-performing carriers to reduce cost and improve delivery time.
- Standardize pricing to avoid inconsistencies and errors.

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel (data preparation)
